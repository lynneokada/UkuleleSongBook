C               F                 C             G7      
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
            C     F           C                 G7
I once was lost, but now am found.  Was blind but now I see.

Baby Beluga in the deep blue sea,

Swim so wild and you swim so free.

Heaven above, and the sea below,

And a little white whale on the go.

A#            F            G       
Baby beluga, baby Beluga, is the water warm?

<string>I&apos;ll Fly Away</string>
C  
Some bright morning when this life is over
F          C      
I'll fly away
C       
To that home on God's celestial shore,
G              C
I'll … fly away.

C   
I'll fly away oh glory
F           C  
I'll fly a way, (in the morning)
C   
When I die Hallelujah by and by
C          G       
I'll  … away

<string>Knee Deep</string>
CaddG
 Gonna put the the world away for a minute 
F
 Pretend I don't live in it 
C               G              C
 Sunshine gonna wash my blues away 
CaddG
 Had sweet love but I lost it 
F
 She got too close so I fought her 
         Am          G               F         G      C
 Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way 

              CaddG
 Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere 
         F
 Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair 
      C                         G                   C      
 Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair 
CaddG
 Sunrise there's a fire in the sky 
       F
 Never been so happy, never felt so high 
       Am                 G           F           G   C
 And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise




On the Road Again

On the road again, just can't get wait to get on the road again.

I find love is makin' music with my friends.

And I can't wait to get on the road again.

We're the best of friends, insisting that the world keep turnin' our way, and our way.

They're really saying, I...I love you

G             D          Em         G
I hear babies cry and I watch them grow,

C                  G
They'll learn much more

D           Em
Than we'll know

C
And I think to myself

<string>Streets of Boston</string>
G                                     C
Now let me tell you of the story of a man named Charlie
        G                      D7
On a tragic and fateful day.
          G                                   C
He put ten cents in his pocket, kissed his wife and family,

And went to [D7]ride on the M[G]TA.

    {c:Chorus.}
   G                               C
Well did he ever return?  No he never returned,
           G             D7  
And his fate is still unlearned.
          G                     C
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston,
          G      D7       G
He's the man who never returned.

Charlie handed in his dime at the Kendell Square station,
And he changed for Jamaica Plain.
When he got there the conductor told him, "One more nickel."
Charlie couldn't get off that train.

     {c:Chorus.}

Now all night long Charlie rides through the station
Crying, "What will become of me?
How can I afford to see my sister in Chelsea,
Or my cousin in Roxbury?"

     {c:Chorus.}

Charlie's wife goes down to the Scolla Square station
Every day at a quarter past two.
And through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich
As the train comes rumbling through.

     {c:Chorus.}

Now you citizens of Boston, don't you think it's a scandal
How the people have to pay and pay?
Fight the fare increase, vote for Walter O'Brien,
And get Charlie off the MTA.

     {c:Chorus.}
